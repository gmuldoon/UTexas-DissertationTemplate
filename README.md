# University of Texas PhD Dissertation Template
This repo includes an example .tex file and associated .sty file for producing a PhD Dissertation at the University of Texas at Austin. Congrats for getting to the point where you're looking for a template and godspeed during the rest of your journey.

# Previous versions
This style file and template were adapted by Gail Muldoon in Spring 2018. The .sty file is based on utdiss2-06.sty, but has been renamed to the more generic utdiss.sty for ease of updates in the future. (Send pull requests!)

The preamble includes contributions from the following individuals, though I would imagine there are more anonymous contributors:

**
 Doctoral Dissertation Format Macros for The Univ. of Texas at Austin
     By Young U. Ryu
 and some fixes by Miguel A. Lerma (malerma@math.utexas.edu)
 and some more fixes by Craig McCluskey (mccluskey@mail.utexas.edu).
 and still more more fixes by Chad Greene
 and yet more fixes by Gail Muldoon (gail.muldoon@utexas.edu)

 This file was first modified in October, 2001 by Craig W. McCluskey
 to meet the Graduate School requirements of March 2001. The name of
 the file was changed to utdiss2.sty to distinguish it from the
 original utdiss.sty of June 1991 and Miguel A. Lerma's utdiss1.sty.

 [Unknown contributors produced versions up to utdiss2-05.py.]
 
 The utdiss2-06.sty is the same as utdiss2-05.py, but I removed the ``Publication No"
 line from one of the header pages. -Chad Greene, 2016.
 
 Changed ``Co-Supervisor" formatting on the signature page.
 - Gail Muldoon, 2018
