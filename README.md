# University of Texas PhD Dissertation Template
This repo includes an example .tex file and associated .sty files for producing a PhD Dissertation at the University of Texas at Austin. Congrats for getting to the point where you're looking for a template and godspeed during the rest of your journey.

# Development
The .sty files posted here are the work of many collaborators, some of whom are unknown. The files passed to me from those who came before were more recent than any I could find online (by more than 5 years), so I decided to post them here for future reference and collaboration. Send pull requests with updates!

## Contributors
The preamble includes contributions from the following individuals, though I would imagine there are more anonymous contributors:

__Doctoral Dissertation Format Macros for The Univ. of Texas at Austin__
     __By Young U. Ryu__
     
__and some fixes by Miguel A. Lerma (malerma@math.utexas.edu)__

__and some more fixes by Craig McCluskey (mccluskey@mail.utexas.edu)__

__and still more more fixes by Chad Greene__

__and yet more fixes by Gail Muldoon (gail.muldoon@utexas.edu).__

## Contributions
-  This file was first modified in October 2001 by Craig W. McCluskey
 to meet the Graduate School requirements of March 2001. The name of
 the file was changed to utdiss2.sty to distinguish it from the
 original utdiss.sty of June 1991 and Miguel A. Lerma's utdiss1.sty.

-  [Unknown contributors produced versions up to utdiss2-05.py.]
 
-  The utdiss2-06.sty is the same as utdiss2-05.py, but I removed the "Publication No"
 line from one of the header pages. -Chad Greene, 2016.
 
-  Changed "Co-Supervisor" formatting on the signature page. -Gail Muldoon, 2018
